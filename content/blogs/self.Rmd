> ## About XU XU

> My name is Xu Xu and I am an international student. I come from [Xi'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an), one of the four major ancient civilization capitals. **People in Xi'an always welcome tourists from all over the world**.
>
> I enjoy travelling and photographing during my free time. I have been to more than 25 countries worldwide. The image below is the northern light I witnessed in Iceland.

> ## Zero to One
>
> Back in 2017, I came to the UK alone for studying the foundation courses and undergraduate degree. I didn't really know anyone here before and my English wasn't that fluent, which makes the beginning became particularly difficult. (*luckily, I soon met my girlfriend here!*) And by doing the following things:
>
> -   Always open to make friends with people around.
> -   Force myself out of my own comfort zone to talk to new people and try new things.
> -   There are no silly questions at univeristy. So never worry about embarrassment.
> -   Talk to Uber or taxi drivers. A good way to communicate with native speakers.
>
> In my own way. I successfully managed to adapt to the new environment. Now, I have local volunteer experience. I recently graduate from University of York with the first class and I am studying at London business school! I truely enjoy everying I have experienced and gained so far and I am so looking forward to my brand new start!
