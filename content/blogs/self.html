<h2 id="about-xu-xu">About XU XU</h2>
<p>My name is Xu Xu and I am an international student. I come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an">Xi’an</a>, one of the four major ancient civilization capitals. <strong>People in Xi’an always welcome tourists from all over the world</strong>.</p>
<p>I enjoy travelling and photographing during my free time. I have been to more than 25 countries worldwide. The image below is the northern light I witnessed in Iceland.</p>

<h2 id="zero-to-one">Zero to One</h2>
<p>Back in 2017, I came to the UK alone for studying the foundation courses and undergraduate degree. I didn’t really know anyone here before and my English wasn’t that fluent, which makes the beginning became particularly difficult. (<em>luckily, I soon met my girlfriend here!</em>) And by doing the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always open to make friends with people around.</li>
<li>Force myself out of my own comfort zone to talk to new people and try new things.</li>
<li>There are no silly questions at univeristy. So never worry about embarrassment.</li>
<li>Talk to Uber or taxi drivers. A good way to communicate with native speakers.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my own way. I successfully managed to adapt to the new environment. Now, I have local volunteer experience. I recently graduate from University of York with the first class and I am studying at London business school! I truely enjoy everying I have experienced and gained so far and I am so looking forward to my brand new start!</p>
